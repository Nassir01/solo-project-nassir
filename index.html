           <p id="para">A drum kit – also called a drum set, trap set (an abbreviation of the word, "contraption"),or simply drums – is a collection of drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in both hands, and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum.

Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used</p>
